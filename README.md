#DESCRIPTION

The Automated Report Generation project focuses on building a Python script that can read data from a file, analyze it, and automatically generate a structured PDF report. This project eliminates the need for manual report preparation by using automation, making data reporting faster, more consistent, and error-free.

The script is developed using Pandas for data handling and analysis, Matplotlib for data visualization, and ReportLab for PDF report creation. The workflow includes:

Data Input – The system reads a dataset (e.g., CSV, Excel, or directly from code).

Data Analysis – Key insights such as average, maximum, and minimum values are calculated.

Visualization – Graphs and charts are generated to represent the data visually.

Report Creation – A PDF report is automatically generated containing:

A report title and introduction

A summary of findings

A well-formatted data table

Graphical representations of the data

Key Features:

Automated analysis and reporting without manual formatting

Integration of data, tables, and charts into a professional PDF report

Reduces human error and saves time in repetitive reporting tasks

Easily customizable for different datasets and business needs

 Applications:

Student performance reports

Sales and financial reporting

Business analytics dashboards

Research data summaries
